        There are a number of different types of crystals some people believe to
        be filled with their own healing abilities for the mind, body, and soul.
        They are thought to promote the flow of good energy and help rid the
        body and mind of negative energy for physical and emotional benefits.
        Historically speaking, crystals are touted as ancient forms of medicine,
        with philosophies borrowed from Hinduism and Buddhism. However, it is
        important to know that there is no scientific evidence to support the
        use of crystals. Despite this, people are still drawn to their colors
        and beauty. The key to indulging in this self-care experience is
        mindfulness, reflection, and acceptance. For instance, researchers found
        that a person's mind may have much more healing power than it is given
        credit. Even though there is no scientific support of crystals, a number
        of people swear by their powers. So, if you are curious to give them a
        go, make sure to keep an open mind and check out what each stone can do
        for you.
